This is a program to patch a copy of FFXIV running under WINE for the Mudra input delay bug that exists as of Patch 6.3.

Shoutout to [https://github.com/UnknownX7/NoClippy](NoClippy) for implementing this fix.

This program is for WINE users who do not wish to run Dalamud. It does not function on Windows.
